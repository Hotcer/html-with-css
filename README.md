# html-with-css
Create a new HTML document with the title "Gaining precision with CSS selectors"
Create a new CSS file and import it into the main HTML document
 Inside the body create a section with the following elements:
     Header containing the text "Shopping List"
         Add an id attribute in the header with the value "title"
         Also add a class attribute with the value "header"
     An unordered list with five items representing items in the purchase
         Each of the elements must have an id as follows: first element "item-1", second element "item-2", etc.
     An ordered list with five items representing the closest supermarkets to your home
         As in the previous list, each of the elements must have an id as follows: first element "item-1", second element "item-2", etc.
     Modify the CSS so that the first element of each list is displayed in red
     Through selector chaining, make the first element of the first list have a font size of 2rem
